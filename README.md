# Communication-Channel
by Victor Taburet and Yannick Paul Klose <br>
PDC Project - EPFL 2019

## Abstract
The aim of this project is to design a communication system that transmits and receives data with applied channel effects. The use of root-raised-cosine functions as a basis and the shift into different frequencies resulted in a very reliable and fast reconstruction.

## Run the code
In oder to run the code enter the text to the text.txt file and run the notebook. In addition the channel effect is applied by the EPFL server, therefore one has to be connected to EPFL network.
